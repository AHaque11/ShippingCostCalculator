# C++ Shipping Cost Calculator

This program uses given values of shipping prices to calculate the shipping cost of an item. Shipping prices vary based on the order total and the shipping
destination. There is also an additional cost for shipping fragile items.

The user enters the name of the item, whether the item is fragile or not, the total price of the order, and the shipping destination. If an invalid response
is entered for whether the item is fragile or an invalid destination is entered, an error message is displayed and the program ends.

After the user answers the prompts, the console displays the item name (capitalized), the total shipping cost, the shipping location, and the total cost of the 
order including shipping. This output is also written to a text file.
